How do we build capacity in a field that is moving at warped speed and when learners far outnumber teachers, and only collective exerptise exists? We leverage hive learning where a diverse community learns together and learns from each other. This is the ethos of datathons. Please join us in New York City on August 5-6 for the 2023 Society of Critical Care Medicine datathon. We will focus on understanding the data first before we do any modeling. Machine learning should be 95% understanding the data - bias from medical devices, bias from who got into the database and who did not, bias from patients not monitored similarly - and 5% modeling. Otherwise, we get artificial intelligence that encodes health disparities.
