IV MIT Critical Data HIAE Datathon in Healthcare | III International Symposium on Big Data in Health.

This event will last 2 and a half days, with the first day dedicated to lectures and the other two days dedicated to practical work in teams with analysis of real databases to answer challenging questions in a collaborative way. The Datathon will have two main themes, in which the teams will be divided. The first clinical genomics and the second in patient journey. The teams will be composed of data science, health and engineering professionals, under the guidance of national and international mentors. Our goal is to encourage a creative, collaborative and fun event that promotes interaction between different specialties.
