>The participating teams will be composed of High school students and Computer Science undergraduate students. Mentors who appreciate and understand Patient Safety will bring their unique perspectives, experiences, and critical thinking to the table!

The MIT Critical Datathon will showcase the value of harnessing the talent and perspectives of students from different disciplines and backgrounds in understanding Patient Safety from a Health Equity lens. Built on the principles of Open Science, Citizen Science, and Open Innovation, this datathon seeks to reframe the issue of patient safety with a stronger focus on health disparities, since treatment injuries disproportionately affect marginalized patient populations.

The event will bring together students from underrepresented groups and Health Equity investigators. To capture diverse perspectives, we will involve professionals across several disciplines:
- Physicians
- Nurses
- Pharmacists
- Social Workers
- Health Equity Researchers
