 Leo focuses on scaling clinical research to be more inclusive through open access data and software, particularly for limited resource settings; identifying bias in the data to prevent them from being encrypted in models and algorithms; and redesigning research using the principles of team science and the hive learning strategy. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The goal is to ascertain that the model does not learn from features that should not affect decision making. Offering chemotherapy should not depend on whether a patient is on Medicaid or has a private insurance, predicting job performance should not be informed by the gender of the applicant, optimizing treatment for sepsis should not be confounded by the use of infrared sensing technology. This is much easier said than done because of the discovery that computers can easily learn sensitive attributes that the human eye does not see. Using real world data to evaluate the models makes this extremely challenging. Excellent model accuracy means existing outcome disparities are fully encoded in the algorithms.
