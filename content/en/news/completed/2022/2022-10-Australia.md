>What's AI? How can it help me? What can I do for my patients?

This program will introduce big data capture analytics and AI in healthcare to empower healthcare leaders, clinicians, nurses and research scientists to confidently engage with these tools to improve their workflow and patient outcomes.

This is an incredible opportunity to learn from world leaders in the field with course content developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Gradient Institute.

The courses will take place in-person with workshops facilitated in each major city nationally starting on July 2022.
