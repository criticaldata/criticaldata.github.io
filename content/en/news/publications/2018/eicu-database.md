 Here we describe the eICU Collaborative Research Database, a multi-center intensive care unit (ICU)database with high granularity data for over 200,000 admissions to ICUs monitored by eICU Programs across the United States. The database is deidentified, and includes vital sign measurements, care plan documentation, severity of illness measures, diagnosis information, treatment information, and more.

>Data were verified for integrity during the data transfer process from Philips to MIT using MD5 checksums. In order to maintain data fidelity, very little post-processing has been performed. Each participant hospital in the database has customized workflows and clinical documentation processes, and as a result, the reliability and completion of data elements varies on a hospital and/or ICU level.
