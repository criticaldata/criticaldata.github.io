title: Severity of Illness Scores May Misclassify Critically Ill Obese Patients
linktitle: Severity of Illness Scores May Misclassify Critically Ill Obese Patients
date: 2018-03-01
description: >
 Severity of illness scores rest on the assumption that patients have normal physiologic values at baseline and that patients with similar severity of illness scores have the same degree of deviation from their usual state. Prior studies have reported differences in baseline physiology, including laboratory markers, between obese and normal weight individuals, but these differences have not been analyzed in the ICU. We compared deviation from baseline of pertinent ICU laboratory test results between obese and normal weight patients, adjusted for the severity of illness.

## Conclusions

Among patients with the same severity of illness score, we detected clinically small but significant deviations in WBC, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen from baseline in obese compared with normal weight patients. These small deviations are likely to be increasingly important as bigger data are analyzed in increasingly precise ways. Recognition of the extent to which all critically ill patients may deviate from their own baseline may improve the objectivity, precision, and generalizability of ICU mortality prediction and severity adjustment models.
