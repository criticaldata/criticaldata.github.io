title: Bayesian fusion of physiological measurements using a signal quality extension
linktitle: Bayesian fusion of physiological measurements using signal quality extension

description: >
 The fusion of multiple noisy labels for biomedical data (such as ECG annotations, which may be obtained from human experts or from automated systems) into a single robust annotation has many applications in phsiologic monitoring. Directly modelling the difficulty of the task has the potential to improve the fusion of such labels. This paper proposes a means for the incorporation of task difficulty, as quantified by 'signal quality', into the fusion process.

>We propose a Bayesian fusion model to infer a consensus through aggregating labels, where the labels are provided by multiple imperfect automated algorithms (or 'annotators'). Our model incorporates the signal quality of the underlying recording when fusing labels. We compare our proposed model with previously published approaches.

## Conclusion

In summary, incorporating signal quality in the BCLAs model better informs it belief in the annotations provided and hence further improves the estimation of the inferred ground truth.
