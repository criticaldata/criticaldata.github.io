title: Feature selection and prediction of treatment failure in tuberculosis
linktitle: Feature selection and prediction of treatment failure in tuberculosis
date: 2018-11-20
description: >
 Tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Drug resistance, which is predicted to rise in many countries worldwide, threatens tuberculosis treatment and control. The objective is to identify features associated with treatment failure and to predict which patients are at highest risk of treatment failure.

>On a multi-country dataset managed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases we applied various machine learning techniques to identify factors statistically associated with treatment failure and to predict treatment failure based on baseline demographic and clinical characteristics alone.

## Conclusions

Machine learning can help to identify patients at higher risk of treatment failure. Closer monitoring of these patients may decrease treatment failure rates and prevent emergence of antibiotic resistance. The use of inexpensive basic demographic and clinical features makes this approach attractive in low and middle-income countries
