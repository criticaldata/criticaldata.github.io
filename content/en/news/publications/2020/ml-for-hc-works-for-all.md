description: >
 Machine learning, data science and artifical intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare (herein collectively referred to as machine learning for healthcare (MLHC)) is positioned to have substantial positive impacts on healthcare, enhancing progress in both the acquisition of healthcare knowledge and the implementation of this knowledge in numerous clinical contexts. However, there are concerns that have been identified with these technologies regarding their potential for negative impacts. In particular that they may damage health equity by either introducing novel biases, or uncritically reproducing and magnifying existing systemic disparities. These concerns have led to a growth of scholarship on the intersection of ethics, AI and healthcare, as well as significant restrictions on the use of patient data for MLHC research.

>The question is whether MLHC will help to remedy these shortcomings or exacerbate them. Models that are trained uncritically on databases embedded with societal biases and disparities will end up learning, amplifying and propagating those biases and disparities under the guise of algorithmic pseudo-objectivity. Similarly, gaps in quality of care will be widened by the development and use of tools that are only beneficial to a certain population - such as melanoma detection algorithm trained on a dataset containing mostly images of light toned skin.

## Conclusions

The gaps in the medical knowledge system stem from the systematic exclusion of the majority of the world's population from health research. These gaps combined with implicit and explicit biases lead to suboptimal medical decision making which negatively impacts health outcomes for everyone, but especially those in groups typically under-represented in health research.

Claims of 'doing better' have, of course, come before in healthcare with respect to bias, and the burden is on MLHC as a field to grow in a fashion that is deserving of the hype it has received. MLHC is not a magic bullet, nor can it address issues of structural health inequity by itself, but its potential may be substantial. Healthcare is flawed, and it must be reformed so that it equitably benefits all. Effective and equitable machine learning, data science and AI will be an essential component of these efforts.
