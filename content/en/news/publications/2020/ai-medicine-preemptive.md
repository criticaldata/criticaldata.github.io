## Abstract

In this paper we propose the idea that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is ushering in a new era of "Earlier Medicine", which is a predictive approach for disease prevention based on AI modeling and big data. The flourishing health care technological landscape is showing great potential - from diagnosis and prescription automation to the early detection of disease through efficient and cost-effective patient data screening tools that benefit from the predictive capabilities of AI. Monitoring the trajectories of both in- and outpatients has proven to be a task AI can perform to a reliable degree. Predictions can be a significant advantage to health care if they are accurate, prompt, and can be personalized and acted upon efficiently. This is where AI plays a crucial role in "Earlier Medicine" implementation.
