description: >
 Unfortunately, patient-level COVID-19 data is not publicly available. These data also lack comprehensive information beyond typical registry resolution. In this interconnected world, we can imagine a unifying multinational COVID-19 electronic health record waiting for global researchers to apply their methodlogical and domain expertise. No such database exists, and this failing is not rooted in absence of technology or precedent.

 >While the number of trials increases, real-time treatment data accumulates, siloed within hospital systems. When considering COVID-19, the insight we could gain from a pooled, publicly available dataset analysed by researchers in academic institutes and industry is invaluable and necessary.

 ## Conclusion

 MIMIC is evidence of the possibility of data sharing beyond BIDMC's critical care department and hospital. Although the academic community has embraced data monetisation, regulatory hurdles, funding apparatuses, and a publish-or-perish academic at the expense of open data sharing, this short-sightedness does not need to be an undoing. A dreadful unprecedented worldwide event deserves an appropriate response, and this response begins with an extraordinary joining of forces - and data - to best understand the event, and the successes and failures of different treatments. The clinical and academic community will learn many lessons during these turbulent times, and cruically, needs to learn that data on health and disease should be shared universally so that everyone can benefit.
