>Minorities face a wide range of health disparities that extend into the ICU. Whether hospitals that predominantly care for minority patients have evidenced the same improvements in critical care outcomes as non-minority-serving hospitals has not been previously investigated.

## Conclusions

A large portion of minority patients receive critical illness care in a small number of minority-serving hospitals, which, over the last 10 years, have not enjoyed the steady decrease in mortality and length of stay that non-minority-serving hospitals have. Whether this reflects a more systemic disparity, whereby African American individuals are more medically disadvantaged upon presentation, or differences in hospital care and resources is not known, but regardless, this observation highlights the profound obstacles facing minorities and minority-serving hospitals.
