 Is artifical intelligence (AI) on track to usurp health record (EHR) as the most disappointing application of technology within medicine? The medical literature is increasingly populated with perspective pieces lauding the transformative nature of AI and forecasting an unforseen disruption in the way we are practising. However, the reality of the available evidence increasingly leaves little room for optimism. As a result, there is a stark contrast between the lack of concrete penetration of AI in medical practice, and the expectations set by the presence of AI in our daily life. But medical AI need not follow the path of the EHR as a clinical tool that to many led to more workflow woes than it was intended to fix.

>If we are going to unavoidably add some disruption to workflow with AI, it should be as painless as possible to circumvent further, or perhaps even reduce, clinical burnout. We believe this will require the combined and cross-disciplinary expertise of an organised and dedicated clinical AI department.

## Takeaway Question

Twenty years now into the 21st century, there is little question that AI will be a defining technology for the foreseeable future. We need visionary clinicians working with expert technical collaborators to establish the organisational structures requisite to translate technological progress into meaningful clinical outcomes. With the innumerable ways in which medicine could be improved, the hype around AI in healthcare will only be realised when the scattered champions of this movement emerge from their silos and begin formally working as a team under the same roof. Our patients are waiting for us to make use of these advances to improve their care, and every day wasted is a missed opportunity. Therefore, we ask - who will establish the first department of clinical AI?
