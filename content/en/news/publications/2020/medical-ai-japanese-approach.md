description: >
 The delay in rearing AI talent in Japan has further challenges when AI is integrated with other complex industries such as medicine and healthcare. To address these challenges, Japan's current public and private sector strategy is to create an environment that generates suficient AI talent. Japan's efforts may serve as a reference point for policy enactment.

>Critical to the development of a robust AI ecosystem is the availability of relevant, reliable data at scale, and the ongoing creation of shared clinical databases throughout Japan underscore this significant potential. If properly anonymized, made readily available to researchers, and paired with advancing educational initiatives, these datasets have a high potential in catalyzing a healthcare revolution in Japan.

## Conclusion

The deployment of AI represents a unique challenge for every nation and nowhere more so than in the improvement of healthcare. Japan faces unique challenges and opportunities anchored in its unique social and technological infrastructure and will serve as a model for technology deployment in tackling common global problems including an aging population, with increasing rural and depopulated areas. Japan works today to develop a medical education system to create a workforce competent in the utilization, evaluation, and improvement of AI and to deploy thoughtful multidisciplinary and multilateral efforts to identify and disseminate best practices from patient-care to system-wide management. Through such an approach, it is uniquely situated to demonstrate to the world a well-designed roadmap of an AI-driven future of healthcare.
