description: >
 From machine learning (ML) and computer vision to robotics and natural language processing, the application of data science and artifical intelligence (AI) is expected to transform health care (Celi et al. 2019). While the rapid development of technological capabilities offers paths toward new discoveries and large-scale analysis, numerous critical ethical issues have been identified, spanning privacy, data protection, transparency and explainability, responsibility, and bias.

>Last year, for instance, a commerical prediction algorithm affecting millions of patients was shown to exhibit significant racial bias, dramatically underestimating the health needs of Black patients (Obermeyer et al. 2019). Trained using health care cost as the proxy for the need for more comprehensive care, the algorithm had been designed specifically to exclude race as a feature, in an attempt to avoid bias - but cost was clearly not a race-neutral measure of health care need.

## Conclusion

The model pipeline framework is a solid step forward for AI ethics in health care, but ultimately frameworks are never enough. If we want to make sure that AI applications in health care contribute to a society we want to live in, we each have to ensure we are building that society - both in AI ethics and beyond.
