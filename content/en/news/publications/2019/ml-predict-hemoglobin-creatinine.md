title: Machine learning can accurately predict pre-admission baseline hemoglobin and creatinine in intensive care patients
linktitle: Machine learning can accurately predict pre-admission baseline hemoglobin and creatinine in intensive care patients
date: 2019-11-29
description: >
 Patients admitted to the intensive care unit frequently have anemia and impaired renal function, but often lack historical blood results to contextualize the acuteness of these findings. Using data available within two hours of ICU admission, we developed machine learning models that accurately (AUC 0.86–0.89) classify an individual patient’s baseline hemoglobin and creatinine levels.

>The aim of this study is to predict the prior-to-admission baseline hemoglobin and creatinine values for patients admitted to the ICU, using objective parameters available within two hours of ICU admission. We present a machine learning workflow and measures of accuracy for the models constructed to create this prediction. We contrast the interpretability of different algorithms, given that model complexity and lack of transparency may result in biased or illogical conclusions going unseen.

## Discussion

It is common for patients presenting with acute illness to have multiple derangements in vital signs and laboratory results, without clarity as to which abnormalities are due to acute illness versus chronic comorbidities. In the absence of historical data, clinical teams use their judgement to estimate the chronicity of abnormalities; these assumptions often guide the type and intensity of treatment. The goal of this work is to improve clinical care through the accurate back-prediction of the pre-admission baseline hemoglobin and creatinine using data commonly available within the first several hours of ICU stay.
