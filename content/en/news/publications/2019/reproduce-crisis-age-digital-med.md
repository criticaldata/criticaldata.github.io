description: >
 Digital medicine must take steps to avoid a reproducibility "crisis" of the kind that has engulfed other areas of biomedicine and human science in the last decade and shaken public confidence in the validity of scientific work. The goal of this paper is to use a historical perspective on reproducibility and its current crisis to suggest how digital medicine can avoid a reproducibility crisis of its own.

>Today, it is peer review that supposedly guarantees that published findings are correct - and implicitly, that such findings could be reproduced if other researchers tried. But as several scholars have shown, the current incarnation of peer review - in which submissions to journals are refereed by two anonymous colleagues - is a historical accident, far from a procedure designed to separate truth from fiction.

## Conclusion

At the same time, to guarantee that every result is completely reproducible would stifle the novelty and creativity that are essential for taking advantage of what digital medicine really does offer.
