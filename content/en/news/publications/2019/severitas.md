description: >
 Severity of illness scores used in critical care for benchmarking, quality assurance and risk stratification have been mainly created in high-income countries. In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), they cannot be widely utilized due to the demand for large amounts of data that may not be available (e.g. laboratory results). We attempt to create a new severity prognostication model using fewer variables that easier to collect in an LMIC

>The dataset from the private ICU was used as a training set for model development to predict in-hospital mortality. Three different machine learning models were applied to fiver different blocks of candidate variables. The resulting 15 models were then validated on a separate dataset from the public ICU, and discrimination and calibration compared to identify the best model.

## Conclusion

Our study proposes a new ICU mortality prediction model using simple logistic regression on a small set of easily collected variables may be better suited than currently available models for use in low and middle-income countries
