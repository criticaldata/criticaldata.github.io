title: Impact of Intensive Care Unit Discharge Delays on Patient Outcomes - A Retrospective Cohort Study
linktitle: Impact of Intensive Care unit Discharge Delays on Patient Outcomes
date: 2019-11-12
description: >
 Patients often overstay in intensive care units (ICU) after they are deemed discharge ready. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of such discharge delays (DD) on subsequent in-hospital morbidity and mortality.

>For all patients, DD (ie, time between request for a ward bed and time of ICU discharge) was calculated. Discharge delays was dichotomized as long (â‰¥24 hours) or short (<24 hours). Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were used to assess the association between dichotomized DD and post-ICU clinical outcomes.

## Conclusion

In this study, long DD was associated with a slight decrease in post-ICU LOS but longer LOS when measured from the point of ward bed request, suggesting a potential role for more aggressive discharge planning in the ICU for patients with long DDs. There was no association between long DD and subsequent mortality or HFD.
