description: >
 Illness severity scores are regularly employed for quality improvement and benchmarking in the intensive care unit, but poor generalization performance, particularly with respect to probability calibration, has limited their use for decision support. These models tend to perform worse in patients at a high risk for mortality. We hypothesized that a sequential modeling approach wherein an initial regression model assigns risk and all patients deemed high risk then have their risk quantified by a second, high-risk-specific, regression model would result in a model with superior calibration across the risk spectrum.

>One of the key challenges has been developing models that are well calibrated. Although prior models have often achieved acceptable observed-to-predicted mortality ratios (OPRs), they frequently under- or over-predict risk across the risk spectrum; in particular, the models tend to be most poorly calibrated in the sickest patients.

## Conclusions

As healthcare continues to digitize and EHR data continues to proliferate, we expect that hospitals will increasingly craft bespoke models in order to quantify the probability of outcomes relevant to clinical decision-making. In the ICU setting, the quantification of disease severity and the risk of hospital mortality can optimize resource allocation; motivate goals of care conversations; and allow clinicians, patients, and families prognostic insight. Because of the wide spectrum of disease severity present in ICU cohorts, we believe strategies for adequately calibrating models across the risk spectrum are necessary. We demonstrate that a sequential approach that combines two linear models is a valid strategy but provides only a modest improvement, and further work is needed to ultimately deliver models that accurately quantify risk in every ICU patient.
