title: Improving community health-care screenings with smartphone-based AI technologies
linktitle: Improving community health-care screenings
date: 2021-04-20
description: >
 Non-communicable diseases cause the majority of global disease burden and mortality. However, in both high-income countries and low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), a substantial number of patients remain unaware that they have these life-threatening conditions. Previous studies have found that approximately half of adult diabetes cases worldwide are undetected, and a considerable portion of patients with hypertension, lung disease, and other chronic conditions remain undiagnosed.

>In many LMICs, frontline health workers such as community health workers form the core of health-care systems, educating community members, and screening and triaging patients. These front-line health workers have been restricted by the services they can provide, and most only use smartphones for rudimentary data storage and communications purposes. Smartphone AI technologies could advance the capabilities of community health workers by empowering them to screen for a variety of medical conditions. Since the analysis is fully automated by AI, these platforms could be readily deployable and user-friendly, requiring minimal training.

## Conclusion

Overall, community-based screenings could substantially reduce morbidity from many diseases that benefit from early detection. Smartphone-based AI technologies hold promise for improving the diagnosis of diseases in resource-limited settings if they are carefully integrated into health systems. Empowering community health workers with smartphone AI technologies could bring preventative screening and diagnosis to low-resource settings.
