title: Deep learning to predict long-term mortality in patients requiring 7 days of mechanical ventilation

description: >
 Among patients with acute respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, tracheostomies are typically placed after approximately 7 to 10 days. Yet half of patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving tracheostomy will die within a year, often within three months. Existing mortality prediction models for prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as the ProVent Score, have poor sensitivity and are not applied until after 14 days of mechanical ventilation. We developed a model to predict 3-month mortality in patients requiring more than 7 days of mechanical ventilation using deep learning techniques and compared this to existing mortality models.

>To address this gap, we sought to develop a mortality prediction model to enhance decision making around tracheostomy. Our objective was to develop and validate deep learning model to predict 3- and 12-month mortality among patients requiring more than 7 days of mechanical ventiliation for acute respiratory failure.

## Conclusion

Here we demonstrate the ability of using a neural network to predict 3- month mortality in patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days. Deep learning prediction models are becoming increasingly important in our data-driven clinical decision-making, especially in the absence of randomized controlled trials. Further optimization of these by external validation, prospective validation using external cohorts, and subgroup analysis within specific populations is integral prior to widespread implementation. Ultimately, integration of deep learning prediction models like ours into electronic health records will provide valuable information to enable providers and patients to more informed decisions.
