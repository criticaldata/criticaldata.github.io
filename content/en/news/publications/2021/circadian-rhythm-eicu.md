The goals of this study were to (1) characterize the circadian variation in critically ill patients by applying cosinor analysis techniques to noninvasive BP time series and (2) to investigate the association of the circadian variation with intensive care unit (ICU) length to stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.

## Discussion

In this analysis of a large multicenter critical care database, we demonstrate that the 24-hour BP rhythm is altered in critically ill patients. The 24-hour BP rhythm was damepened and phase shifted in sicker patients, patients with sepsis and organ dysfunction, and those on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or inotropes. Both dampening and phase shifting were associated with longer length of stay and higher inpatient mortality.
