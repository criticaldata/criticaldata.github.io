 If you build it, they will come. MIT Critical Data grew organically out of a belief the current biomedical research apparatus is insufficient in its efforts to solve the panoply of health issues our society faces today. Understanding that every minute that health data sits in a silo is another lost opportunity to advance our understanding of disease, the Laboratory for Computational Physiology developed an open-access clinical database containing all of the electronic health record data collected in of adult intensive care units (ICUs) at the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital and entitled it MIMIC ("Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care").
