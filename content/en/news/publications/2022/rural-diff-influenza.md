>We queried the 2019 National Health Interview Survey for respondents aged 18 years and older. To provide national estimates of influenza vaccination coverage, we performed sample-weighted multivariable logistic regressions and predicted marginal modeling while adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and urbanâ€“rural household designation.

## Conclusions

Self-reported influenza vaccination rates were lower in rural than in urban areas among adults of all age groups and both genders. Using community leaders for health promotion, augmentation of the community health care workforce, and provision of incentives for providers to integrate influenza vaccination in regular visits may expand influenza vaccine coverage.
