title: A novel Vascular Leak Index identifies sepsis patients with a higher risk for in-hospital death and fluid accumulation
linktitle: Vascular Leak Index identifies sepsis patients with a higher risk for in-hospital death
date: 2022-04-11
description: >
 Sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is characterized by vascular leak. Treatment for sepsis, specifically intravenous fluids, may worsen deterioration in the context of vascular leak. We therefore sought to quantify vascular leak in sepsis patients to guide fluid resuscitation

>We performed a retrospective cohort study of sepsis patients in four ICU databases in North America, Europe, and Asia. We developed an intuitive vascular leak index (VLI) and explored the relationship between VLI and in-hospital death and fluid balance using generalized additive models (GAM)

## Conclusions

Our VLI identifies groups of patients who may be at a higher risk for in-hospital death or for fluid accumulation. This relationship persisted in models developed to control for severity of illness and chronic comorbidities.
