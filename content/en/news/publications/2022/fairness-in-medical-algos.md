title: Operationalising fairness in medical algorithms 
linktitle: Fairness in medical algorithms

description: >
 In this special issue, we highlight that machine learning algorithms should not be focused solely on accuracy but should be evaluated with respect to how they might impact disparities in patient outcomes. Our special issue aims to bring together the growing community of healthcare practitioners, social scientists, policymakers, engineers, and computer scientists to design and discuss practical solutions to address algorithmic fairness and accountability.

>To prevent artifical intelligence (AI) from encoding the disparities that exist, algorithms should predict an outcome as if the world were fair. If designed well, AI may even provide a way to audit and improve the way care is being delivered across populations.

## Conclusion

There is a long road ahead before we can leverage the zettabytes of data that are routinely collected in the process of care. We should not only invest in storage and compute technologies, federated learning platforms, GPTs, GRUs, and NFTs. Machine learning in healthcare is not just about predicting something for the sake of prediction. The most important task is to augment our capacity to make decisions, and that requires understanding how those decisions are made.
