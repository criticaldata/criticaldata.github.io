title: Assessment of Racial and Ethnic Differences in Oxygen Supplementation Among Patients in the Intensive Care Unit
linktitle: Racial and Ethnic Differences in Oxygen in the ICU
date: 2022-07-11
description: >
 Pulse oximetry (SPO2) is routinely used for transcutaneous monitoring of blood oxygenation, but it can be overestimate actual oxygenation. This is more common in patients of racial and ethnic minority groups. The extent to which these discrepancies are associated with variations in treatment is not known.

>The objective was to determine if there are racial and ethnic disparities in supplemental oxygen administration with inconsistent pulse oximeter performance.

## Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohory study, Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients received less supplemental oxygen than White patients, and this was associated with differences in pulse oximeter performance, which may contribute to known race and ethnicity-based disparities in care.
