 A critical step towards addressing AI model bias and subgroup disparities is the establishment of common principles, guidelines, and standards that model developers adhere to. These standards would need to emphasize the importance of fairness and trasparency in AI systems' design and deployment.

>AI in healthcare is intended to improve access to quality healthcare, especially for those who are marginalized. It is worrisome to find evidence across many works that these models utilize non-clinical demographic attributes and are likely to propagate existing disparities. Current attempts to understand how imaging models encode and use non-clinical demographic information for prediction are encouraging, but are still limited. More interdisciplinary communication and collaboration between AI researchers, healthcare providers, social scientists, and the public would be needed to advance fairness, transparency, and accountability of medical imaging models.
