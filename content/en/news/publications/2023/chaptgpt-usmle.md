title: ChatGPT passing USMLE shines a spotlight on the flaws of medical eduction
linktitle: ChatGPT passes USMLE

description: >
 The goal of the USMLE exam is to assess "a physician's ability to apply knowledge, concepts, and principles, and to demonstrate fundamental patient-centered skills that are important in health and disease that constitute the basis of safe and effective patient care". While achieving these goals does require some rote memorization, we are increasingly realizing that the ability to regurgitate mechanistic models of health and disease, as in what often takes place during rounds, may be less important in this age of information being rapidly accessible at your fingertips.

>Perhaps the most important lesson from the success of LLMs in passing examinations such as the USMLE is that now is the time to rethink how we train and evaluate our students. The glory in medicine has traditionally gone to the innovators, and they are certainly critically important. But just as important are those clinicians who fully leverage the knowledge, skills, and treatments we already possess, and have the time, willingness, and ability to pass these on to, and create more relevant and valid assessments for, the next medical generation.
