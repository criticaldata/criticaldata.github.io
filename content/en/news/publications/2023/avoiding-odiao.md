title: Delivering on NIH data sharing requirements - avoiding Open Data in Appearance Only
linktitle: Avoiding Open Data in Appearance Only
date: 2023-06-27
description: >
 In January, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a Data Management and Sharing Policy aiming to leverage data collected during NIH-funded research. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated that this practice is equally vital for augmenting patient research. In addition, data sharing acts as a necessary safeguard against the introduction of analytical biases. While the pandemic provided an opportunity to curtail critical research issues such as reproducibility and validity through data sharing, this did not materialise in practice and became an example of 'Open Data in Appearance Only' (ODIAO). Here, we define ODIAO as the intent of data sharing without the occurrence of actual data sharing (eg, material or digital data transfers).

>We introduce the term 'Open Data in Appearance Only' (ODIAO) which applies to datasets that are branded as open but are accessible through a complicated drawn-out costly process that prevents an average student from gaining access to the dataset before she/he graduates. Typically, only students of the richest universities are able to access and publish off these datasets.
