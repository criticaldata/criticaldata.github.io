description: >
 Driving pressure and mechanical power may be important mediators of lung injury in ARDS; however, there is little evidence for strategies directed at reducing these parameters. We applied predictive modeling to estimate the effects of modifying ventilator parameters on driving pressure and mechanical power

## Conclusion

This novel conditional modeling confirmed expected response patterns for driving pressure, with the response to adjustments depending on subjects' lung mechanics. Furthermore, a tidal volume-driven approach should be favored over a breathing frequency-driven approach when aiming to reduce mechanical power.
