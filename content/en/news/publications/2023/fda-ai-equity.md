>To facilitate representative samples of racially diverse populations, as seen in the COVID-19 Pfizer and Moderna trials, the FDA should foster collaborations among pharmaceutical companies and minority-serving institutions to enroll additional patients and broaden manufacturing cycles to prioritize recruitment of underrepresented patients. While the roll-out of medical devices and software offers society an array of new technologies, the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA must acknowledge that barriers exist for the most vulnerable. To realize the equity in health outcomes all patients deserve, the FDA must look to examine and test medical devices and software across racially diverse populations.
