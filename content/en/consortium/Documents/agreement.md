## Article I: General Information
### 1.1	Name
The name of the organization shall be “The MIT-LCP Clinical Data Consortium”, and is hereafter referred to in these rights and benefits as “the Consortium”.
### 1.2	Principal Office
The principal office of the Consortium will be located at:
>The <a href="https://lcp.mit.edu">Laboratory for Computational Physiology</a> (“LCP”) MIT, E25-505 <br>
77 Massachusetts Ave.<br>
Cambridge, MA 02139

### 1.3	Purpose
The purpose of the Consortium is to accelerate data sharing and knowledge discovery in healthcare analytics. The primary approach to accomplishing this objective is by establishing an academic-industry collaborative centered on advancing the development of improved clinical datasets and analytical methods, while fostering the community of users and stakeholders for amplified dissemination and impact.

## Article II: Membership
### 2.1 Conditions of Membership
Consortium Membership is intended for any academic entity, association, partnership, organization, governmental agency, company, corporation, or nonprofit entity interested in supporting the initiative to advance healthcare analytics. Admittance to the Consortium will be recognized upon: (a) acceptance of signed agreement with MIT and (b) remittance of appropriate annual dues at the time of signing.

## Article III: Consortium Activities
### 3.1	Privileges of Membership
Members will receive regular updates and notifications of Consortium events, news, and publications. While in good standing, Consortium Members are entitled to participate in all the activities described below.
### 3.2	Consortium Collaboration
Members may participate in regular Consortium and LCP meetings, in which students, faculty, staff, and other Members present their research and recent results and Member may provide input and discuss the relationship of the research to industrial needs. Through LCP facilitation, Members may reach out to other collaborating Members, and upon mutual agreement will be connected for discussion and potential collaboration.
### 3.3	Early Access
In addition to the publicly released data sources, Members will receive early access to clinical datasets under active development, affording an early start to Member research initiatives and interest. This data will be de-identified and released to Members for feedback and revisions. Members will also have direct access to LCP faculty and scientific staff to navigate use and understanding of the data.
### 3.4	Clarification of Data Use Agreement for clinical data
If Member openly disseminates research results based on MIMIC clinical data, Member agrees to publicly provide sufficient detail in order to permit reproduction of the research, such as information about the training and validation cohorts, feature definitions and study design assumptions. Functions employed to process and engineer features should be described. Provision of the source code to a public repository is highly suggested.
It is explicitly noted that users of MIMIC data are free to use such data without restriction in the development and evaluation of proprietary commercial technology. Specifically:
- 3.4.1) Member may use MIMIC datasets or other PhysioNet restricted data to develop proprietary commercial technology;
- 3.4.2) Member is not required to publish the results from any work in connection with the development of proprietary commercial technology;
- 3.4.3) In the event Member commercializes or otherwise makes available the proprietary technology this will not be deemed to require Member to share source code or other proprietary technology under the Physionet Agreement; and
- 3.4.4) In no event shall Member be required to publish or otherwise share any proprietary technology wholly or partially developed using MIMIC datasets or other PhysioNet restricted data.

### 3.5	Curricula
Member may participate in curricular events hosted by LCP, including workshops and Datathons. Members may also sponsor said events for publicity and recognition of contributions to the effort, enabling access to hundreds of potential data scientist participants. Registration fees may be waived for active participation, but travel and housing costs are the sole responsibility of the Members.
### 3.6	Annual Conference
The Consortium will hold an annual Conference to discuss Consortium activities and to present new or on-going research developments. Members may voluntarily present their Consortium-related research. Conference timing and location will be determined to accommodate a majority of Members, but will be decided ultimately by the Director.
### 3.7	Additional Benefits
To help foster and maintain a strong relationship among Members and LCP, the following benefits will be made available to Member.
-	Member may participate in personal meetings with LCP faculty and scientific staff to advise and provide feedback to LCP leadership on worthwhile directions of research.
-	Member may participate in regular LCP meetings
-	Member may seek interactions with LCP’s graduate students and postdocs for purposes of recruitment and internships.

## Article IV: Steering Committee
### 4.1	Director
The Consortium Program will be supervised by Professor Roger G. Mark. If, for any reason, the Director is unable to continue to serve in this role, MIT shall appoint a successor and notify the Member
### 4.2	Steering Committee
The Steering Committee will consist of representatives from Member organizations and provide input and suggestions to the Director and LCP faculty and staff on the direction and initiatives of the Consortium.
### 4.2 Meetings of the Steering Committee
Steering Committee will meet as a whole during the Consortium Annual Conference. Additional Steering Committee meetings may also be held throughout the year. While some effort will be made to coordinate a meeting of the steering committee, it will likely entail several smaller subgroups at various times.
Representatives of the Director will reach out to Consortium Members to facilitate individual or group meetings.

## Article V: Amendments
MIT and the Members may agree in writing from time to time on amendments to these rights. Proposed amendments of these rights may be submitted in writing to MIT by any member of the Consortium.
Proposed amendments will be presented to all members of the Steering Committee for advice. MIT will make the final determination on any proposed amendments.
