The MIT LCP Clinical Data Consortium is a unique organization engaging in advancing health data analytics research through interdisciplinary industry-academic collaboration. This association of scientist, clinician, and industry leaders are devoted to building and curating uniquely powerful open health datasets, accelerating the discovery of novel machine learning models and applications focused on quality improvements in health outcomes.
Benefits of Membership:

- Early Access - Consortium members are granted early access to the growing MIMIC dataset ahead of public open release, to jumpstart their research investigations
- Individualized Support - Meet with LCP researchers for personalized support or discuss interests. Including limited opportunities for visiting researchers.
- Community - Engage with the community to generate knowledge and make better use of data resources, and gain the opportunity to provide input for refinements and future directions

Through this Consortium, we aim to build a growing community of like-minded innovators, foster the exchange of analytics knowledge, and enhance the impact of clinical data. We will further development of open access databases, such as the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC). These repositories of high quality structured clinical data will be enhanced with additional features, including medical imaging, and ultimately become federated by integrating new data sources from other institutions and countries. Consortium activities will include an Annual Conference to discuss research and progress, and regular Steering Committee Meetings to plan the future directions and evolution of activities, to enhance the usefulness of resources. Join us now to affect the future of health data analytics.
